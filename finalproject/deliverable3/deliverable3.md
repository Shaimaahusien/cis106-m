## Connecting Ubuntu to the internet
If you have a wireless-enabled computer, you can connect to a wireless network that is within range to get access to the internet, view shared files on the network, and so on.

Open the system menu from the right side of the top bar.

Select Wi-Fi Not Connected. The Wi-Fi section of the menu will expand.

Click Select Network.

Click the name of the network you want, then click Connect.

If the name of the network is not shown, scroll down the list. If you still do not see the network, you may be out of range, or the network might be hidden.

If the network is protected by a password (encryption key), enter the password when prompted and click Connect.

If you do not know the key, it may be written on the underside of the wireless router or base station, or in its instruction manual, or you may have to ask the person who administers the wireless network.

The network icon will change appearance as the computer attempts to connect to the network.

If the connection is successful, the icon will change to a dot with several curved bars above it (). More bars indicate a stronger connection to the network. Fewer bars mean the connection is weaker and might not be very reliable
